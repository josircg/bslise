		<h3>Mission</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-8 col-12 mb-4">
			EU-Citizen.Science contains a wide array of free, self-directed training modules on citizen science on <a href="https://moodle.eu-citizen.science/">its Moodle page</a>. The themes of the training modules range from introduction to citizen science over research design and methods, engagement and impact to communication and regulations and ethics.<br /><br />

			At this event, we will showcase three of these training modules and offer the opportunity to meet the trainers who developed them. We will launch the final version of the EU-Citizen.Science platform and show its new features. Finally, the winners of the #MonthOfTheProjects campaign will be presented.
